### Theoretical Physics
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" img src="https://github.com/pfroysdon/reading_rack/blob/main/figures/IMG_3748.jpg">
</p>

- [Eight Lectures on Theoretical Physics - Max Planck](https://amzn.to/3JHmnq2) Great lectures and very eloquent.  Dr. Planck takes soft approach to introduce very advanced topics of the day (1909) and describes the problems beautifully.  I wish I was alive and present when he presented. 11/22
- [Theoretical Physics - Georg Joos](https://amzn.to/3JXoKGk) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [Theoretical Nuclear Physics - Blatt and Weisskopf](https://amzn.to/3FIazm9) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [An Introduction to Nuclear Fission](https://amzn.to/3JXp1sQ) This states that it is a graduate-level book, but I think it is really an undergrad book.  The math is easy, most of which you can do mentally, and the concepts are well described.  A good introduction to the subject. My primary criticism is the notation is not introduced and it is unclear throughout the text, e.g., it is not clear if a variable is a vector or scalar until you see the variable in an equation and perform a calculation, then by deduction you can see that the variable is clearly a scalar.  11/22
- [Physics of Waves - Elmore and Heald](https://amzn.to/3FCJD7m) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [Einstein's Theory of Relativity - Max Born](https://amzn.to/3LGl255)
- [Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics - Byron and Fuller](https://amzn.to/3FF3R09) The first few chapters cover the basic equations of classical physics with complete examples using vectors and matrices, calculus of variations and Hilbert spaces in physics, the next few chapters look at analytical functions, Green's theorem and integrals, and the book concludes with an introduction to Group Theory.  The notation is defined and very clear throughout with usage of standard math notation for scalars, vectors, matrices and formulae notation, e.g., summations, products, integrals, etc.  The authors even provide complete derivations (not skipping steps) in several examples. 12/22
- [Atomic Physics - Max Born](https://amzn.to/42mWoMS)  Like many of these older books, this one is no exception.  I really like the author's style of writing.  Non-native English speakers, or translation of a language, often portrays things very differently and I certainly like this perspective.  While this book was significantly modified by the co-authors, they did maintain much of the original text from Dr. Born and the text is well written. 12/22
- [A Survey of Physical Theory - Max Planck](https://amzn.to/3FGi2SL) This is a topical book (a survey) wherein Dr. Planck provides his thoughts on the current state of physics (in 1925).  It is rather easy to follow, very little math (I counted fewer than 10 equations), with a particularly interesting discussion on electromagnetic theory. 12/22
- [Equations of Mathematical Physics](https://amzn.to/3FCRKk8) Great book that covers the mathematics of theoretical and experimental physics. 01/23
- [Mathematics for Physicists](https://amzn.to/40mXrKY) Great book that covers the mathematics of theoretical and experimental physics. 01/23
- [The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory](https://amzn.to/3Z124ct)
- [Niels Bohr's Times, In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity](https://amzn.to/42se2im)
- [History of Physics - Max von Laue](https://amzn.to/40mXExK)
- [Subtle Is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein](https://amzn.to/3TO0kCJ)
- [Relativity - Albert Einstein](hhttps://amzn.to/3Z4lu0b)
- [Uncertainty: Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, and the Struggle for the Soul of Science](https://amzn.to/3lx3jCI)

### Math
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" img src="https://github.com/pfroysdon/reading_rack/blob/main/figures/IMG_3744.jpg">
</p>

- [Mathematische Formeln - Sieber](https://amzn.to/404Vtzj) **My preferred short-form (48 pages) math reference.** Apparently every German high school student receives this book! I received this book when I studied in Germany, and during my undergrad I added notes throughout this text, e.g. the definition of a series can be defined in sequence or with a summation, I added the summation form, etc.  **I have considered translating this book (with my notes) for English speaking students.  Send me an email if you are interested.**
- [Handbook of Mathematics - Bronshtein](https://amzn.to/3TzRzM7) **My preferred long-form (1251 pages) math reference.**  This book helped me get through college.  This book is commonly used in German schools for science and engineering students. 
- [Matrix Mathematics - Bernsten](https://amzn.to/3yU17bq) A single source for nearly all linear algebra derivations, proofs and theory.  This is a great book to have once you master the skills in Noble and Golub's books (of course assuming you already read Strang's book).
- [Applied Linear Algebra - Noble & Daniel](https://amzn.to/3TyxeqE) This is a graduate-level book that covers more difficult topics and theory in linear algebra.  I used this in graduate school and I highly recommend this book.
- [Matrix Computations - Golub & van Loan](https://amzn.to/42mX7O6)  This is another graduate-level book that specifically discusses difficult applied problems like numerical optimization using the modified Gram-Schmidt, CS Decomposition, and sparse unsymmetric linear systems.  I used this in graduate school and I highly recommend this book. 
- [Linear Algebra and its Applications - Strang](https://amzn.to/3yUlllc)  This is the **best** starter book in linear algebra (undergraduate level).  The concepts are clearly defined and build in difficulty with each chapter.
- [Theory of Optimal Search - Stone](https://amzn.to/40kD3tO)  Great book. The author is right (in the preface), you really need to understand mathematics to understand this book.  It is very dense. 11/22
- [Optimal Search for Moving Targets - Stone, et.al.](https://amzn.to/403UDTb)  Great book.  Most of the methods use ILP or MILP, and they have a few examples in Matlab.  Several years ago I built an ILP toolbox ([ILP Lite](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/applied_math/ilpLite)) and I was able to solve many problems in this book using ILP Lite. 11/22
- [Real Analysis: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook - Cummings](https://amzn.to/3lsoKoy)  I really like this young authors approach to Real Analysis.  He provides several examples that are clear and complete.  Most authors skip steps and expect the reader to fill-in the gaps, Cummings does not. 12/22
- [Proofs: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook - Cummings](https://amzn.to/3Z6swS0)  This is a great book, and if you read the author's book on Real Analysis.  **The dedication in this book is priceless.** 12/22
- [Mathematical Notation - A guide for Engineers and Scientists](https://amzn.to/3ndqHp6) This is a great guide that is similar to my [Math Handbook](https://www.roysdonfibonaccipress.com/shop/p/math-handbook-for-machine-learning), and a great reference if you are confused with math symbols, e.g., you cannot remember the symbol for a method or you cannot remember the meaning of a math symbol. 12/22
- [Mathematical Reasoning - Sundstrom](https://amzn.to/3Z4zffd) This is the textbook I used when I took an undergraduate math proofs course.  This is a great introduction.
- [div grad culr and all that - Schey](https://amzn.to/40ozVgD)  I used this book while studying for aerospace engineering graduate school entrance exams.  This was a great review and highly recommended.
- [Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences - Boas](https://amzn.to/3n9FJMN)  This is another book I used while studying for aerospace engineering graduate school entrance exams.  This was a great review and highly recommended.
- [Proofs from THE BOOK](https://amzn.to/4042Dn7) Mathematician Erdos, though a atheist, believed that if God had a book of the purest of math proofs, they would be assembled into "the Book".  The highest compliment he could pay to a colleague’s work was to say, "That’s straight from The Book." This book is an ensemble of proofs that many mathematicians believe might be worthy of "the Book." 01/23 
- [A History of Mathematical Notations](https://amzn.to/4042Dn7) this is a complete history of mathematical notation written by Professor Florian Cajori in 1923.  This is a fantastic book that I have only read chapters of.  Originally published as 2 volumes, to present day (100 years later), it is still the most comprehensive treatment of the origins of mathematical notation. 01/23

### Electrical Engineering, Navigation Theory, State Estimation, Signal Processing
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" img src="https://github.com/pfroysdon/reading_rack/blob/main/figures/IMG_3743.jpg">
</p>

- [Aided Navigation, GPS with High Rate Sensors - Farrell](https://a.co/d/7uAmnbz) **This was my PhD adviser**.  His book is the reason I petitioned him to be his PhD student.  Farrell and this book are known world-wide.  **This book is one of the few books that I have seen where every variable is clearly defined and explained**.  I learned so much from Dr. Farrell and I have carried forward his instruction into how I write [my books](https://roysdonfibonaccipress.com).  This is a great book on Kalman Filters, GPS-INS navigation, AHRS, GPS positioning, smoothing, and state estimation.
- [Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation Systems - Groves](https://a.co/d/dR3mMAZ)  This is my go-to book when I need the kinematic equations and their derivatives in multiple reference frames, e.g., ECI to ECEF, or NED to ECEF, etc.  Of course his book has many other topics, but the reference frame descriptions are the best I have seen in any book.  This is a great book that I reference frequently.
- [Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing, Vol 1, Estimation Theory - Kay](https://a.co/d/5twMxmZ) This is the best 3 volume series on signal processing and specifically **estimation theory**.  There are many books, but Kay maintains great notation and derivations throughout.  Some may find these books a bit terse, but once you learn the notation, the books are a great resource.  I have used these books since graduate school.
- [Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing, Vol 2, Detection Theory - Kay](https://a.co/d/5bkDDJZ) This is the best 3 volume series on signal processing and specifically **detection theory, e.g. anomaly detection**.  There are many books, but Kay maintains great notation and derivations throughout.  Some may find these books a bit terse, but once you learn the notation, the books are a great resource.  I have used these books since graduate school.
- [Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing, Vol 3, Practical Algorithm Development Theory - Kay](https://a.co/d/68dbK3y) This is the best 3 volume series on signal processing and specifically on **practical considerations, performance evaluation, metrics, trade-offs, and testing**.  There are many books, but Kay maintains great notation and derivations throughout.  Some may find these books a bit terse, but once you learn the notation, the books are a great resource.
