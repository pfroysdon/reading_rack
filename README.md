### Theoretical Physics
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" img src="https://github.com/pfroysdon/reading_rack/blob/main/figures/IMG_3748.jpg">
</p>

- [Eight Lectures on Theoretical Physics - Max Planck](https://a.co/d/fXXLdD6) Great lectures and very eloquent.  Dr. Planck takes soft approach to introduce very advanced topics of the day (1909) and decribes the problems beautifully.  I wish I was alive and present when he presented. 11/22
- [Theoretical Physics - Georg Joos](https://a.co/d/9C2IwI5) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [Theoretical Nuclear Physics - Blatt and Weisskopf](https://a.co/d/7Ic3WSX) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [An Introduction to Nuclear Fission](https://a.co/d/d42gBdj) This states that it is a graduate-level book, but I think it is really an undergrad book.  The math is easy, most of which you can do mentally, and the concepts are well described.  A good introduction to the subject. My primary criticism is the notation is not introduced and it is unclear throughout the text, e.g., it is not clear if a variable is a vector or scalar until you see the variable in an equation and perform a calculation, then by deduction you can see that the variable is clearly a scalar.  11/22
- [Physics of Waves - Elmore and Heald](https://a.co/d/csDqUIq) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [Einstein's Theory of Relativity - Max Born](https://a.co/d/ggTQWRW)
- [Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics - Byron and Fuller](https://a.co/d/8f3Sraa) The first few chapters cover the basic equations of classical physics with complete examples using vectors and matricies, calculus of varaitions and Hilbert spaces in physics, the next few chapters look at analytical functions, Green's theorm and integrals, and the book concludes with an introduction to Group Theory.  The notation is defined and very clear throughout with usage of standard math notation for scalars, vectors, matricies and formulae notation, e.g., summations, products, integrals, etc.  The authors even provide complete derivations (not skipping steps) in several examples. 12/22
- [Atomic Physics - Max Born](https://a.co/d/4vvXOeR)  Like many of these older books, this one is no exception.  I really like the author's style of writing.  Non-native English speakers, or translation of a language, often potrays things very differently and I certainly like this perspective.  While this book was significantly modified by the co-authors, they did maintain much of the original text from Dr. Born and the text is well written. 12/22
- [A Survey of Physical Theory - Max Planck](https://a.co/d/77jb6oT) This is a topical book (a survey) wherein Dr. Planck provides his thoughts on the current state of physics (in 1925).  It is rather easy to follow, very little math (I counted fewer than 10 equations), with a particularly interesting discussion on electromagnetic theory. 12/22


### Math
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" img src="https://github.com/pfroysdon/reading_rack/blob/main/figures/IMG_3744.jpg">
</p>

**Note:** I have ~36 books that I have read and used in this area.  I will post the photos, links, and reviews soon.  Below is a partial list.

- [Handbook of Mathematics - Bronshtein](https://a.co/d/awF7Soi) **Absolutely the best reference I have for math.**  This book helped me get through college.  Apparenly it is commonly used in German schools, and it was a German student that recommended the book to me when I was a sophmore. 
- [Matrix Mathematics - Bernsten](https://a.co/d/cLOjA5T) A single source for nearly all linear algebra derivations, proofs and theory.  This is a great book to have once you master the skills in Noble and Golubs books (of course assuming you already read Strang's book).
- [Applied Linear Algebra - Nobel & Daniel](https://a.co/d/7Ytdmg2) This is a graduate-level book that covers more difficult topics and theory in linear algebra.  I used this in graduate school and I highly recommend this book.
- [Matrix Computations - Golub & van Loan](https://a.co/d/3nzKslD)  This is another graduate-level book that specifically discusses difficult applied problems like numerical optimization using the modified Gram-Schmidt, CS Decomposition, and sparse unsymmetric linear systems.  I used this in graduate school and I highly recommend this book. 
- [Linear Algebra and its Applications - Strang](https://a.co/d/iNpdzHy)  This is the **best** starter book in linear algebra (undergraduate level).  The concepts are clearly defined and build in difficulty with each chapter.
- [Theory of Optimal Search - Stone](https://a.co/d/g24uCYR)  Great book. The author is right (in the preface), you really need to understand mathematics to understand this book.  It is very dense. 11/22
- [Optimal Search for Moving Targets - Stone, et.al.](https://a.co/d/2f2S4Um)  Great book.  Most of the methods use ILP or MILP, and they have a few examples in Matlab.  Several years ago I built an ILP toolbox ([ILP Lite](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/applied_math/ilpLite)) and I was able to solve many problems in this book using ILP Lite. 11/22
- [Real Analysis: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook - Cummings](https://a.co/d/7Gj5DGH)  I really like this young authors approach to Real Analysis.  He provides several examples that are clear and complete.  Most authors skip steps and expect the reader to fill-in the gaps, Cummings does not. 11/22
- [Proofs: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook - Cummings](https://a.co/d/isHNgCW)  I really like this young authors approach to Proofs.  He provides several examples that are clear and complete.  Most authors skip steps and expect the reader to fill-in the gaps, Cummings does not. 11/22
- [Mathematical Notation - A guide for Engineers and Scientists](https://a.co/d/gNmvUQh) This is a great guide that is similar to my [Math Handbook](https://www.roysdonfibonaccipress.com/shop/p/math-handbook-for-machine-learning), and a great reference if you are confused with math symbols, e.g., you cannot remember the symbol for a method or you cannot remember the meaning of a math symbol. 12/22


### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
<p align="center">

</p>

- [Deep Learning with Python, Second Edition 2nd Edition - Chollet](https://a.co/d/cZmyLF1)  Good tutorial book for a beginner in ML. Several examples that you will not find elsewhere. 06/22
- [Reinforcement Learning, second edition: An Introduction - Sutton](https://a.co/d/8pJHcRp) Great book on RL.  I took very careful notes (I will soon post them [here](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Math_Notes) and implemented these methods on a few projects. 10/21
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning - Bishop](https://a.co/d/3ptLp5u)  Good book, mostly simple ML methods, but very well written by an experienced practitioner at Microsoft Research. 04/22
- [Pattern Classification 2nd Edition - Duda and Hart](https://a.co/d/8bA2Bdt) Good book, something I have used since graduate school.  Duda discusses fundamental concepts at a time when this field was new, but still relevant today. 04/22
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition - Hastie and Tibshirani](https://a.co/d/2vP8iRA) Fantastic book.  Graduate-level and very detailed mathematics and examples.  I frequently use this reference in my work. My notes and derivations are posted [here](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Math_Notes). 09/21
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R - Hastie and Tibshirani](https://a.co/d/aDsRvba) Fantastic book.  Undergraduate-level with simplifed examples from the prior book. I frequently use this reference in my work. 09/21
