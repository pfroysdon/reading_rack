# Textbooks


## Theoretical Physics
- [Eight Lectures on Theoretical Physics - Max Planck](https://a.co/d/fXXLdD6) Great lectures and very eloquent.  Dr. Planck takes soft approach to introduce very advanced topics of the day (1909) and decribes the problems beautifully.  I wish I was alive and present when he presented. 11/22
- [Theoretical Physics - Georg Joos](https://a.co/d/9C2IwI5) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [Theoretical Nuclear Physics - Blatt and Weisskopf](https://a.co/d/7Ic3WSX) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [An Introduction to Nuclear Fission](https://a.co/d/d42gBdj) This states that it is a graduate-level book, but I think it is really an undergrad book.  The math is easy, most of which you can do mentally, and the concepts are well described.  A good introduction to the subject. 11/22
- [Physics of Waves - Elmore and Heald](https://a.co/d/csDqUIq) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22
- [Einstein's Theory of Relativity - Max Born](https://a.co/d/ggTQWRW)
- [Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics - Byron and Fuller](https://a.co/d/8f3Sraa)
- [Atomic Physics - Max Born](https://a.co/d/4vvXOeR)
- [A Survey of Physical Theory - Max Planck](https://a.co/d/77jb6oT) Great book by a master.  Like many physics books there is a lot of algebra, linear algebra and some calculus.  If you have a good foundation in these subjects, then the physics will be easier to understand. 11/22

## Math
- [Theory of Optimal Search - Stone](https://a.co/d/g24uCYR)  Great book. The author is right (in the preface), you really need to understand mathematics to understand this book.  It is very dense. 11/22
- [Optimal Search for Moving Targets - Stone, et.al.](https://a.co/d/2f2S4Um)  Great book.  Most of the methods use ILP or MILP, and they have a few examples in Matlab.  Several years ago I built an ILP toolbox ([ILP Lite](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/applied_math/ilpLite)) and I was able to solve many problems in this book using ILP Lite. 11/22
- [Real Analysis: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook - Cummings](https://a.co/d/7Gj5DGH)  I really like this young authors approach to Real Analysis.  He provides several examples that are clear and complete.  Most authors skip steps and expect the reader to fill-in the gaps, Cummings does not. 11/22
- [Proofs: A Long-Form Mathematics Textbook - Cummings](https://a.co/d/isHNgCW)  I really like this young authors approach to Proofs.  He provides several examples that are clear and complete.  Most authors skip steps and expect the reader to fill-in the gaps, Cummings does not. 11/22

## Graph Theory and Machine Learning
- [Network Science - Barabasi](https://a.co/d/hVfSKuM)
- [Networks: An Introduction - Newman](https://a.co/d/3St5PNH)
- [Graph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra - Kepner and Gilbert](https://a.co/d/fOf79Uo)
